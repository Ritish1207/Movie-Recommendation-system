The movie recommendation system is my title of project I developed a flask web application which is made on anime movies data set where attributes are anime_id, name, genre, type, episodes, rating, and members. based on the data when someone selects the movie which he/she has watched before based on the filtering the data is shown as topN suggestions as per user requirements. I have used tools Python, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, and SQLalchemy .I used TF-IDF vectorization to convert genre information into a numerical format suitable for similarity calculations.
